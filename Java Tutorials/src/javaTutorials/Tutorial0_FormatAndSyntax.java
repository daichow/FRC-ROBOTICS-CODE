	// Syntax is the grammar of programming
	// It tells the program how to read your code
	// Without proper syntax, your code will have errors that are represented by red lines
	
	// Semicolons are used to indicate that you are done with a line of code
	// int variable1 = 0;
	// int variable2 = 0;
	// The semicolons at the end of each line of code is ending each line to separate it from the other lines
	
	// Whitespace is used to separate sections of the code
	// White spaces include: spaces, carriage returns, and tabs (\n, \t, " ")
	
	// When creating variables, classes or projects, the name must be in proper convention
	// Projects and classes must be in UpperCamelCase 
	// This means that every new word should start with a capital
	// Methods and variables should be in lowerCamelCase
	// This means that every new word should start with a capital but the first
	// Constants must be all caps
	
	// Whenever a java method, structure, or loop is created, the lines of code within the curly braces should be indented
	// Ex. 
	// if(){
	// 		The code in here should be indented
	// }
	
	// void myMethod(){
	// 		This should be indented too
	// }
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//huaigofwaudal // this red line means that your line of code has an error
