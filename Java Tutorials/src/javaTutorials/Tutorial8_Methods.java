	// Methods are little groupings of lines of code
	// They can be called in other methods
	
	// static void methodName(){

	// }
	
	// This is the basic structure of a method
	// The static part lets the method be accessed in a static way
	// The void part is the return type of the method
	// The method can return any kind of value like int, double, String, boolean, etc.
	// To return a value in a method, you would do: return 1.0;
	// Void means that it doesn't return a value
	
	// A method is called by doing: methodName();
	// If the method that is being called returns a value, methodName() would be equivalent to a value.
	// You would be able to use the method's value like a normal value.
	// Ex. variableName = methodName();
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// Create a new method
		// This new method will just print "This is printing from a method that I made"
		// Call the new method here and it should print out that line into the console
	}
	
	// Create your new method here
