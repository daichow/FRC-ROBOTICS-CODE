	// A boolean is a data type that holds either a true or false
	// Booleans are the results of using comparison operators
	// Comparison operators can be ==, >, <, <=, >=, or !=
	// Don't get confused with the assignment operator =
	// = is used to assign values and == is used to compare values
	// == -> is equal to
	// >  -> is greater than
	// <  -> is less than
	// <= -> is less than or equal to
	// >= -> is greater than or equal to
	// != -> is not equal to
	// The exclamation mark can also be used to invert a boolean value
	// Ex. !variableName 
	// Logic operators are &&, || ("and" and "or")
	// && compares the left and right boolean values, and is true if both are true
	// || compares the left and right boolean values, and is true if one of the two is true
